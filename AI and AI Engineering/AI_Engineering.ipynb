        "Modern AI after 2020 is defined primarily by scale. Models such as ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Midjourney operate at unprecedented levels of size and computational intensity, consuming significant amounts of global electricity and pushing up against the limits of publicly available internet data for training. This scaling has two major consequences. The first is that **AI models have become dramatically more capable**, which has enabled a rapid expansion of applications that improve productivity, generate economic value, and enhance daily life. More people and teams can now use AI to accomplish increasingly complex tasks. The second consequence is **that training these large models demands enormous datasets, specialised expertise, and massive compute budgets—resources that only a small group of organisations can access**. As a result, a “model as a service” paradigm has emerged in which these organisations expose their models through APIs so others can build AI-powered applications without training models themselves.\n",
        "\n",
        "This dynamic creates a landscape where **demand for AI applications continues to grow while the barriers to building them continue to fall**. This shift has turned AI engineering—the discipline of creating applications on top of ready-made machine learning models—into one of the fastest-growing areas in technology. Although AI applications existed long before large language models became dominant, powering systems such as fraud detection, churn prediction, and product recommendations, the new generation of large-scale models introduces both expanded opportunities and new challenges. Many traditional principles of deploying machine learning systems remain important, but LLMs bring issues such as hallucination, prompt dependency, evaluation complexity, and new forms of system design. The combination of accessible models and skyrocketing demand is reshaping how AI systems are built and deployed.\n"
