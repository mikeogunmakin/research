Monthly tracking works better for long-term views, while daily tracking is helpful for immediate feedback but tends to be noisy.\n",

        "A typical analysis begins by looking at the number of events triggered by the feature. While this metric shows how often the feature is used, it can be misleading. A spike in event count may reflect a handful of heavy users or even a bug generating duplicate events. Since the number of events is just the number of users multiplied by the number of events per user, it does not necessarily represent an increase in actual popularity.\n",

        "A more meaningful starting point is the number of unique users using the feature. This gives a better sense of reach, but even this metric is influenced by changes in the overall size of the user base. During periods of increased user acquisition, the number of feature users can rise simply because there are more people in the product, not because the feature has become more popular.\n",

        "\n",
        "User segmentation provides even deeper insight. New users and old users often behave differently, and high acquisition periods can hide these differences. By breaking users into new and old cohorts, it becomes clear how each group responds to feature changes. For example, new users may respond strongly to increased feature visibility, while old users show no change at all. This may indicate that the feature is inherently more valuable to newcomers, or that existing users have already formed habits that are hard to change.\n",
